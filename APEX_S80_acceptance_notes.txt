Bogdan suggested the following procedure for estimating vertical and horiziontal angle acceptance.  I've added a few clarifications.

For every \delta (+/- 0.045) and z_target there is a value
of \Omega ~ 4 msr listed in the table on page 1.

For each z_target we can approximate the acceptance as a square region as follows:
The range_theta_h = integral/value_max, e.g. 4.2-6.3 deg for z_t=0
(central value of theta_h given as avg. of distribution)

The range_theta_v = \Omega/range_theta_h -- it varies with \delta and z_t.

Every event within the range_v and range_h is accepted.

Best,

Bogdan

Hi Bogdan,

A question about John's acceptance results: it seems that the most direct translation of John's calculation into a reach is using the figure on page 2, but there are a few things I'm not sure of. What number on the y-axis of that figure corresponds to 100% efficiency for detecting tracks from a given zbeam, at a given angle (provided they are within the momentum and vertical-angle acceptance of the spectrometer)? And, when the curve is below its maximum, what does this mean? Is there only a subset of momenta that fall within spectrometer acceptance? Only a subset of vertical angles?


I will meet with James again to discuss the reach calculation in the next couple of days; this is the one piece of information that I'm not sure how to use properly.


Thanks,
Natalia

Hi Bogdan,
In fact, I just finished them.
